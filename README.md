If you are using the Kaggle platform, then datasets are avaliable at:

CelebA (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset),
UTKFace (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new).

Add them to the notebook.

To run and load a saved model, first create a dataset to load the model on Kaggle, then add this dataset and finally edit the file path for the model in the notebook to fnish loading the model.
